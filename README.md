# Abigail Bowerman

Some of my interests are:
-Writing computer programs, particularly in Python
-Taking pictures, usually of nature (though I'm by no means not a professional)
-Playing games such as computer games, board games, and video games

### Technical Background
    Overtime, I've developed experience in different programming languages.  I'm experienced with Java and Python and familiar with C/C++ and HTML/CSS.  I also have a little experience with JavaScript.  Currently, I am learning Swift and Kotlin.
